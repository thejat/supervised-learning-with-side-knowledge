This repo has some experiments for the paper titled "Generalization Bounds for Learning with Linear, Polygonal, Quadratic and Conic Side Knowledge" hosted [here](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.7764).

###Dependencies:

 - CVX: Download the free version from http://cvxr.com/cvx/download/

 - barwitherr.m : Download the file from Matlab FileExchange http://www.mathworks.co.uk/matlabcentral/fileexchange/30639-bar-chart-with-error-bars/content/barwitherr.m

###Additional Information:

 - Change the nRuns variable at the beginning of the script to a low number (such as 1). If the script is run as is, it can take ~30000 seconds to finish (based on running on a MBP13 with 4 cores).
